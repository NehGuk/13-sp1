# Semester Project 1

An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in the ficticious city of Oslotlantis. Developing a website for this immaginary museum was my first project as a front-end development student at the Norwegian School of Technology and Digital Media (Noroff).

## Description

Playful rather than serious. Simple rather than complex. Objective rather than long-winded. These were the basic premises that guided me in the conceptualisation of the Community Science Museum website. From the colour palette to the typographic choices, from the selection of the images to the navigation structure of the project, the choices that I have made reflect a well-defined goal: develop something that is functionally simple and aesthetically appealing to young target audiences.

- Target audience: primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children;
- The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering;
- It should take for granted that the audience is inquisitive and intelligent;
- The website should be responsive and be easy to use on a variety of devices.

This project should reflect the student's creative and technical knowledge and skills based on the first semester curriculum. This includes:

- Design principles;
- Project management;
- Communication technology;
- Developing with HTML/CSS.
